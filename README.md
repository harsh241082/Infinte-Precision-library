# Infinite Precision Library

A C++ library for performing arithmetic operations with arbitrary precision.

## Features

- High-precision integer arithmetic
- Support for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Efficient computation for large numbers

## Project Structure

- `myinf_arth.hh` - Header file with class definitions
- `my_inf_arith.cpp` - Implementation file
- `inf_arth.cpp` - Additional arithmetic functions
- `Makefile` - Build configuration

## Building

To compile the project, run:

```bash
make
```

## Usage

Include the header file in your project:

```cpp
#include "myinf_arth.hh"
```

Then use the classes and functions for infinite precision arithmetic operations.
